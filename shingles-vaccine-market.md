<p><strong>Shingles Vaccine Major Market Players</strong></p>
<p><p>The shingles vaccine market is primarily dominated by major players such as Merck and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), each offering distinct products and strategies. Merck's Shingrix, a recombinant zoster vaccine, has significantly propelled the company's market position since its launch in 2017. Shingrix is administered in two doses and has shown over 90% efficacy in preventing shingles and postherpetic neuralgia, driving substantial sales growth. In 2022, Merck reported sales exceeding $2 billion for Shingrix, reflecting increasing public awareness and recommendations for vaccination among older adults.</p><p>GlaxoSmithKline also plays a pivotal role in the shingles vaccine market with its product, Zostavax, a live attenuated vaccine. However, Zostavax is less favored compared to Shingrix due to its lower efficacy and single-dose regimen. Although GSK has experienced steady sales, the market share is influenced by the preference for Shingrix. GSK's overall revenue from vaccines was approximately $9.6 billion in 2022, though shingles vaccine sales are a smaller fraction of this figure.</p><p>The competitive landscape is further characterized by rigorous clinical analyses and marketing efforts aimed at increasing vaccination rates, particularly in aging populations. Looking ahead, the shingles vaccine market is projected to grow, driven by rising incidence rates, aging demographics, and expanded immunization recommendations. With growing healthcare investments and increasing awareness, the global shingles vaccine market is expected to reach around $4 billion by 2027, showcasing significant potential for both Merck and GSK. Their strategic initiatives and product offerings will play a crucial role in capturing market share and driving future growth.</p></p>
